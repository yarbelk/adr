Text = "# Background\n\nADRs should be easy to work with with tooling, but also by hand if you're\nsomewhere far away from your normal setup.  It seems most people just use\nmarkdown.  Coming from a python background, I am not against this, but\nhaving used sphinx, I'm happy to separate the easy to read from the\neasy to manage.\n\n# Complication\n\nIts not fun to muck about with markdown programatically\n\n# Options Considered\n\n1. Bite the bullet, do lots of parsing and regex\n2. use a human readable format, convert it to markdown automatically\n\n# Decision\n\n1) Use TOML\n\nI decided to try using TOML, because its super easy to edit\nas a human.  The data structure for an ADR is simple enough\nthat It is *really* easy to work with programatically.\n\nOne thing to track is that the text block should use multiline format\nto make it easier to read\n\n\n2) Automatically render to GFM\nThere is a github flavoured markedown library for go, I will automatically\nrender out to it\n\n# Outcome\n"
