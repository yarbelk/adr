Text = "# Background\n\nLets say I decided to store all ADRs as XML in ADR-0001\nand then I stopped being drunk; so I now need to make a new\ndecision.  I write a new ADR, which is ADR-0003, which says:\nstore all ADRs as json and supercede ADR-0001.\n\nADR-0001 is updated and says superceded by ADR-0003.\nLater I realize i'm a fool, and JSON doesn't support really anything\ncoherent.  So i say: ADR-0005 supercedes ADR-0003: use YAML or TOML\n\n# Complication\n\nDo I also updated ADR-0001, and say its superceded by ADR-0003 AND \nADR-0005\n\n# Options Considered\n\n1. Yes: semi-clearer chain of decisions, go and update the entire chain of ADRs on new\nADR creation\n2. No: easier to program, can recover the chain of decisions using a DAG later\nyou just update the specified ADRs only, and not their 'parent' ADRs.\n\n# Decision\n\n2) actually preserves the timeline better without extra effort. So do 2.\n\n# Outcome\n"
