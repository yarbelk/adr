# Background

It is important to maintain continutity of design and thought when running a project.
This becomes exponentially more complicated and important as more people contribute.
When you are using Agile, you don't have "Design Docs" and Specs (this is considered
a *good* thing).  As a result, they cannot fulfil this role (which they don't do well
anyway).  Historically, I've used the story history and epic history to track decisons.

# Complication

As the team size and number of repositories grew, just using the history becomes un-
managable.  As such a different plan is needed.

# Options Considered

1. Spend more time managing the history
2. Switch to using ADRs

# Decision

Use ADRs

# Outcome
